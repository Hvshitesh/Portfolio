# Hi there

I'm currently in my final year of pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering degree at Pune Institute of Computer Technology. As a passionate technologist, I'm deeply interested in Web Development, Cloud Engineering, and DevOps. With a strong foundation in core subjects like Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems, and Database Management, I excel at problem-solving and thrive in dynamic, challenging environments. My enthusiasm lies in learning new technologies and applying them to address real-world challenges.
My commitment to innovation and continuous improvement drives me to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape. I aspire to make a positive impact through my work, particularly in the Cloud and DevOps domains.

Type "cd ~/projects" then "ls" to see details of some of the projects I have developed over my three plus years of coding experience.
